# Google Workspace Extension for Gemini CLI

[![Build Status](https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/workspace/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/workspace/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

The Google Workspace extension for Gemini CLI brings the power of your Google
Workspace apps to your command line. Manage your documents, spreadsheets,
presentations, emails, chat, and calendar events without leaving your terminal.

## Cloudflare Worker MCP

This repo also ships a self-hostable **remote MCP server** on Cloudflare Workers.
The public `/mcp` surface is **code-mode-first** (search + execute — the entire
toolset in ~1k tokens regardless of tool count): clients discover with
`code_mode_search` (which filters the catalog inside a sandbox and returns only
the subset needed), then use `code_mode_run` to orchestrate the internal Google
Workspace tools (`await tools.<name>(args)`) — a far smaller token footprint
than advertising every native tool directly (per Cloudflare's
[Code Mode](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/model-context-protocol/codemode/)).
The Worker still provides stateless JSON-RPC over `/mcp`, single-Worker
deployment, D1-backed operation/asset logging, and per-user Google OAuth
(multi-user, keyed by Google account). See
[`/gws/setup`](src/frontend/pages/gws/setup.astro) (served at `/gws/setup` once
deployed) for the full setup and deploy walkthrough: OAuth client creation,
`wrangler secret put`, KV/D1 bindings, `pnpm run migrate:remote`, `pnpm run
deploy`, and connecting an MCP client with the session bearer token.

## Prerequisites

Before using the Google Workspace extension, you need to be logged into your
Google account.

## Installation

Install the Google Workspace extension by running the following command from
your terminal:

```bash
gemini extensions install https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/workspace
```

## Usage

Once the extension is installed, you can use it to interact with your Google
Workspace apps. Here are a few examples:

**Create a new Google Doc:**

> "Create a new Google Doc with the title 'My New Doc' and the content '# My New
> Document\n\nThis is a new document created from the command line.'"

**List your upcoming calendar events:**

> "What's on my calendar for today?"

**Search for a file in Google Drive:**

> "Find the file named 'my-file.txt' in my Google Drive."

## Commands

This extension provides a variety of commands. Here are a few examples:

### Get Schedule

**Command:** `/calendar:get-schedule [date]`

Shows your schedule for today or a specified date.

### Search Drive

**Command:** `/drive:search <query>`

Searches your Google Drive for files matching the given query.

## Headless / Remote Environments

If you're using the extension over SSH, WSL, Cloud Shell, or another environment
without a local browser, you can authenticate using the headless login tool:

```bash
npm run auth-utils -- login
```

This prints an OAuth URL you can open in any browser (local machine, phone,
etc.). After signing in, paste the credentials JSON into the CLI. Credentials
are read securely from `/dev/tty` and are never exposed to the AI model. See the
[development docs](docs/development.md#headless--remote-environments) for more
details.

## Deployment

If you want to host your own version of this extension's infrastructure, see the
[GCP Recreation Guide](docs/GCP-RECREATION.md).

## Important security consideration: Indirect Prompt Injection Risk

When exposing any language model to untrusted data, there's a risk of an
[indirect prompt injection attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_injection).
Agentic tools like Gemini CLI, connected to MCP servers, have access to a wide
array of tools and APIs.

This MCP server grants the agent the ability to read, modify, and delete your
Google Account data, as well as other data shared with you.

- Never use this with untrusted tools
- Never include untrusted inputs into the model context. This includes asking
  Gemini CLI to process mail, documents, or other resources from unverified
  sources.
- Untrusted inputs may contain hidden instructions that could hijack your CLI
  session. Attackers can then leverage this to modify, steal, or destroy your
  data.
- Always carefully review actions taken by Gemini CLI on your behalf to ensure
  they are correct and align with your intentions.
